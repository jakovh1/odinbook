# 🅾 Odinbook

A **toy social media platform** built with Ruby on Rails as part of [The Odin Project’s Rails Final Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project).  
This project demonstrates full‑stack Rails development, real‑time features, and modern frontend integration.

## 🚀 Getting Started with Odinbook

Welcome to the live demo of **[Odinbook](https://odinbook-e1fz.onrender.com/)**!  
This project is deployed on Render’s free tier, which means the container may “sleep” after periods of inactivity. If the site hasn’t been visited for a while, the first request can take up to **a minute** to boot the container. Thanks for your patience — once it’s awake, everything runs smoothly.

### 🔑 Test Accounts
You can log in immediately using one of the pre‑seeded demo users:

- **Username:** `firstUser`  
- **Username:** `secondUser`  
- **Username:** `thirdUser`  
- **Password (for all):** `sifre123`

Feel free to create your own account as well. New users are fully supported.

### 📧 Email Notes
When you sign up, the app will send a welcome email via SendGrid. On free‑tier deployments, these messages often land in your **Spam** folder — so be sure to check there if you don’t see it in your inbox.

👉 Jump in, explore the features, and don’t worry if the first page load feels slow — that’s just the container waking up.
